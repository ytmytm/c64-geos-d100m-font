This is GEOS printer driver (however it might be used by non-GEOS program)
for D-100M printer. (AFAIK D-100M uses standard Epson escape codes, so it could
work with other printers too).
The unusual thing in this driver is that it uses text mode for printing.
Line graphics data (640x8 bitmap) is transferred to printer as the new character
set definition and then printed as such.

This source is released under GNU GPL license.
This is text file for Turbo Assembler Macro. I can't remember if it uses its
extensions.
